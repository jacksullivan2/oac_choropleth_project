Programming project I was assigned during my Summer Internship at OAC. The project was to write a reusable script which outputs a UK choropleth map with boundaries existing around each UK Local Authority District. The outputted choropleth maps will be used by clients of OAC's to understand the geographic distribution of their policyholders. 
The script is written to allow the user to choose the what the colour weighting is based of (value of policies per LAD or amount of policies per LAD).
